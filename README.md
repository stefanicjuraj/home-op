# Home Operations (Home Op)

Home Operations (Home Op) is a web application designed to create, manage, plan and keep track of your upcoming bills and payments, home inventory, invited visitors, important contacts, security protocols, household maintenance, and home wishlist.

The objective of the application is to simplify and optimize the management and administration of household tasks via secure, responsive, intuitive, and user-friendly experience.

As I am sharing a similar process to many students finishing their studies, the natural progression for us now is to start the next significant phase of our lives: finding a place to call home. This transition from academia to establishing our own personal space signifies a pivotal moment of growth and independence. It's a time filled with excitement and possibilities, as we search for a space that resonates with our aspirations and lifestyle, a place where we can lay down our roots, create new memories, and start building our futures.
